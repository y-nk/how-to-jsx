# how to jsx

A small git presentation on the basics of jsx mechanisms, how to use it, and a sneak peek into how to implement a vdom with it.

## how to read this presentation

Each commit is structured to represent a slide, or a progress of some kind. The commit message gives the gist of it for a fast understanding, and the extended commit explains it all.

You can browse through the commits yourself using your tool of choice, or in case you're interested i've created [a vscode extension to drive the git head with keyboard shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=y-nk.gitplay).

You can also run the server by installing the dependencies first, and then run `yarn start`. The magic of hot reload should make it work throughout the presentation.
